# Website drafts
`Maamedia websites that have been created in draft and can then be accessed and extended by anyone.`

You will find each draft in its own folder. Then there is usually a "index.html" file, even if it is located in a different folder or file on the crm.maamedia.org website.

# ðŸš¨Using
These drafts are free to use. You do not have to mention the original author, or if Maamedia Developer (the person who made the draft) is mentioned in a draft, you can delete it.

If you want to expand these sketches into your own projects, thatâ€™s perfectly permissible!

# âš¡Contributing
If you are a developer and want to expand your drafts even further, we are waiting for you! Feel free to edit the Github file you are expanding. You can also discuss this with Maamedia founders: `puma@maamedia.org` or ? `mito@maamedia.org`.

But if youâ€™ve made your own sketch, donâ€™t add it to your Maamedia project. There are only projects started by Maamedia developers or founders in this project. But yes you too can be a Maamedia developer!

# ðŸ’»HTML
All drafts are (usually) written in HTML code. However, in some cases, they may include PHP, JS, and CSS.

## ðŸŽ²Bootstrap
To make the sketches great, easy, unique and beautiful, we use Bootstrap in the sketches. Some drafts also use FontAwesome.
